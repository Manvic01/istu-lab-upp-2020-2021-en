Task 5 Project schedule
======

1) For now you have views (mockups) and data structure (ER-model). You need to design [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)-functions that will connect your views and your data.

    - input parameters
    - output data

    Your API should contain functions to get and to update data of your system
